# OpenSCAD Language Support for IntelliJ Platform

[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/index.html) language plugin for IntelliJ Platform IDEs (Idea, PyCharm, etc). It provides :

* Preview split panel, based on [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/index.html) rendering with [viewstl](https://github.com/omrips/viewstl)
* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Code navigation
* Formatting
* Code folding support
* Structure views
* Library support
* Color picking
* Actions for opening OpenSCAD and exporting model
* Color scheme close to the built-in OpenSCAD editor

## Configuration

### OpenSCAD executable

[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) needs to be installed on your machine for the preview editor and the context menu actions.

The plugin will search for an OpenSCAD executable in standard installation paths at startup.

Go in *Settings* -> *Languages & Frameworks* -> *OpenSCAD* to manually set your installation path and activate/deactivate the preview editor.

### Global libraries

The libraries configured in OpenSCAD are automatically added as libraries in your IDE.
You will be able to access them through navigation and code completion with take them into account.

### Formatting

The formatting options are located in *Settings* -> *Editor* -> *Code Style* -> *OpenSCAD*.

### OpenSCAD color scheme

The OpenSCAD color scheme can be loaded in *Settings* -> *Editor* -> *Color Scheme* -> *OpenSCAD* -> *Scheme* -> *OpenSCAD.Default*.

## Preview panel

The plugin split preview editor will allow you to modify your code and easily check its result in the IDE.

The preview is done with an STL file, generated using OpenSCAD command line, then displayed in an HTML page using [viewstl](https://github.com/omrips/viewstl).
Due to the conversion into an STL file, some information like colors are lost.

You can refresh the preview by clicking on the refresh button at the top right of the preview panel.
The STL file generation can take some time if your model is complex. For faster preview,
you can temporarily lower the [$fn variable](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Other_Language_Features#.24fa.2C_.24fs_and_.24fn).

Temporary files are kept in a temporary folder (*out*, *temp*, *tmp* or *.tmp* folder depending on your IDE) at your project root.
If you are using a CVS (i.e. git), best is to ignore this folder.
The plugins automatically deletes the temporary files. If your IDE has crashed or if you encounter preview errors, you can close all scad editors and
delete the temporary folder to restart from scratch.

## Context menu

Right-clicking on a scad file will give you access to two context menu actions :

* *Open in OpenSCAD* : To open an OpenSCAD instance for the given file.
* *Export as...* : To export your model in various format using OpenSCAD command line.
