## Test development version from GitHub

GitHub actions automatically build and publish plugin distribution.

To test a specific version, go in the *Code* tab -> *tags* menu. Click on the version you wish to test and download the *idea-openscad-x.x.x[-SNAPSHOT].zip* file.

In IntelliJ, go in *File* -> *Settings...* -> *Plugins* -> ![configuration icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/master/platform/icons/src/general/gearPlain.svg?sanitize=true) -> *Install Plugin from Disk...* and select the distribution zip file.

Restart IntelliJ to test development version.
